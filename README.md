# RainOrShine
Got a big event planned and want to make sure nothing rains on your parade? Well consult the clouds and come RainOrShine you will always be dressed for the weather!

I have been able to produce a working site that utilises an API for viewing weather forecast conditions.
This code allows the user to search for any city by name and return a current and 5 day (current day inclusive for a total of 5 days) weather forecast that will tell them the conditions, temperature, humidity and date.

The user will be able to make use of this site and help them to plan their activities based on the inclimate weather conditions on that given day!
